# 🌊 UmiLog - iOS Dive Log App (Map‑first)

> A zero‑friction, offline‑first dive log with a map‑first IA, guided logging wizard, and a tidy history. Built to make casual logging fast, trustworthy, and fun.

## 🎯 Vision

UmiLog (海ログ – "sea log") reduces friction before and after a dive. The map is the home, logging is a short guided flow, and everything works offline with optional end‑to‑end encrypted backup.

## ✨ What’s New (2025)

- Map‑first IA with two modes: My Map and Explore
- Regions → Areas → Sites tiering with bottom‑sheet details
- Middle tab triggers the Logging Wizard (overlay FAB removed)
- Viewport‑based map pin loading for performance; clustering remains enabled
- 4‑step Logging Wizard with validation and fast‑path save after Step 2
- Wildlife Pokédex with species search and sightings
- History with KPI tiles, grouped cards, and quick actions
- Profile with stats, achievements, and Cloud backup controls
- NEW: Underwater theme with glossy, watery transitions and animated ocean overlays (toggle in AppState)

## 🧭 Information Architecture

Tabs: Map · History · Log · Wildlife · Profile

- My Map: Visited • Wishlist • Planned
- Explore: All • Nearby • Popular • Beginner
- Tiering across both: Regions · Areas · Sites
- Details use bottom sheets that snap at 24% / 58% / 92%

## 🧩 Logging Wizard

1) Site & Time – date/time prefilled; site picker half‑sheet with nearby + search + “Add new”
2) Depth & Duration – large numeric pickers with unit toggles and guardrails
3) Air & Conditions – chips for gas, temperature, visibility, current (optional with sensible defaults)
4) Wildlife & Notes – species search with chips and free‑text notes

- Persistent review bar shows essentials; Save enabled after Step 2
- On save, the Wizard persists Dive + Sighting rows and updates site list state

## 🗺️ Site Details Card

Bottom‑sheet or full‑screen detail follows the “Grand Bazaar” pattern: hero image header, title, quick‑facts chips (Max depth · Avg temp · Visibility · Type), description, difficulty, and a prominent “Log Dive at <Site>” CTA. Wishlist is primary in Explore; Log is primary in My Map.

## 🏗️ Architecture (high‑level)

- Platform: iOS 17+ (SwiftUI)
- Database: GRDB + SQLCipher (encrypted SQLite)
- Sync: CloudKit with E2E encryption (optional)
- Voice: On‑device Speech framework
- Performance: <2s cold start, <100ms field commits

Key components added in this refactor:
- SpeciesRepository in UmiDB for search and “popular species” by sightings count
- LogDraft model extended with selected species and notes
- WizardSaver to persist Dive, Sighting, and site visited/wishlist state and to broadcast refresh notifications

## 📊 History & Profile

- History: KPI tiles (Dives, Bottom Time, Max Depth), grouped by day, cards with editable chips, quick actions (Duplicate, Create template, PDF), multi‑select (Export | Send for sign‑off | Delete)
- Profile: Certification header, stats tiles, achievements, Cloud backup toggle with last sync, data controls (Import CSV/UDDF, Export all, Backfill), Face ID lock

## 📱 Requirements

- iOS 17.0 or later
- iPhone 12 or newer recommended
- Apple Watch Ultra for immersion detection (optional)
- ~50MB storage for offline datasets

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Map engine (default: MapLibre)
- The default map engine is MapLibre Native (DiveMap) with GeoJSON runtime sources and clustering.
- Fallback: MapKit (NewMapView) remains available for testing.
- Style: Resources/Maps/dive_light.json (v8 minimal)
- Data: Resources/Maps/sites.geojson, shops.geojson
- Package: MapLibre via SPM (maplibre-gl-native-distribution)

If SPM fails fetching the binary artifact with a cache error, clear the broken artifact and resolve again:
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Caches/org.swift.swiftpm/artifacts/https___github_com_maplibre_maplibre_native_releases_download_ios_v6_19_1_MapLibre_dynamic_xcframework_zip
xcodebuild -resolvePackageDependencies -project UmiLog.xcodeproj
```

1) Install tools
```bash
brew install xcodegen swiftlint
```
2) Generate project
```bash
xcodegen generate
```
3) Open workspace and run
```bash
open UmiLog.xcworkspace
```
If using a free Apple ID, remove Push/iCloud capabilities; all core features work offline.

## 🧪 Testing

### Visual polish checks
- Smooth watery transitions between tabs and sheets
- Glassy cards use ultraThinMaterial with subtle highlights
- Bubbles and caustics overlays remain subtle (opacity < 0.25) and non‑interactive

### Automated

```bash
xcodebuild test -workspace UmiLog.xcworkspace -scheme UmiLog -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

## 📈 Acceptance Targets

- Start log from My Map ≤ 2 taps; essentials complete ≤ 30 s
- Wishlist from Explore ≤ 2 taps (double‑tap pin or swipe)
- My Map vs Explore recognition ≥ 90% (hallway test)

## 🗺️ Roadmap (phased)

- Phase 0 – Foundations: tokens, remove overlay nav ✅
- Phase 1 – Map IA: segmented modes, chips, tier tabs, bottom sheets ✅
- Phase 2 – Logging & History: 4‑step wizard, KPI history, bulk export (CSV)
- Phase 3 – Wildlife: Pokédex, sightings attach to dives
- Phase 4 – Backfill & Polish: backfill flow, Explore filters sorting, a11y

Non‑goals this pass: QR sign‑off, shop stamps, computer imports
