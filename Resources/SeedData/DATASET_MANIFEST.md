## Data Processing Pipeline

### Phase 1: Input Validation (→ 1,161 sites)
- Loaded multi-source comprehensive dataset
- Performed initial geo-boundary validation
- Rejected entries with missing coordinates

### Phase 2: Quality Filtering (→ 1,131 sites)
Non-dive locations removed using keyword heuristics:

**Excluded Keywords:** stadium, park, sports, arena, field, baseball, football, soccer, cricket, racetrack, training, complex, school, building, office, shopping, center, airport, station, factory, plant, museum, temple, church, mall

**Examples Rejected:**
- Stade Jean Dauger (stadium in France)
- Bay Meadows Racetrack (racing venue in California)
- Kanbayashi Snowboard Park (ski resort in Japan)
- Bayer-Sportpark Wuppertal (sports complex)

### Phase 3: Deduplication (→ 1,120 sites)
- Clustered sites by name + location (Haversine distance < 1km)
- Removed 11 duplicate entries
- Maintained first occurrence based on ID sorting

### Phase 4: Standardization & Cleaning
All sites standardized with:
- Validated latitude/longitude pairs
- Regional assignment based on coordinates
- Consistent field mappings
- License information (primarily CC0 and ODbL)
- Source attribution (Wikidata, OpenStreetMap, etc.)

### Phase 5: Referential Validation
- **Dive Logs:** Cross-referenced against cleaned sites (2,775/2,876 valid)
- **Sightings:** Cross-referenced against dive logs (6,934/7,186 valid)

### Phase 6: Regional Tiling & Compression
- Split sites into 5 geographic regions
- Generated gzip-compressed tiles for efficient OTA delivery
- Created manifest with bounds and metadata per tile

## Data Sources & Attribution

### Primary Sources

1. **Wikidata SPARQL** (~50% of sites)
   - Open-access geographic features with diving context
   - License: CC0 (public domain)
   - Authority: Wikimedia Foundation
   - Query focuses on: dive sites, reefs, atolls, shipwrecks

2. **OpenStreetMap (Overpass API)** (~50% of sites)
   - Community-curated diving locations and shops
   - License: ODbL (Open Data Commons)
   - Updated regularly from OSM data
   - Tags: diving, scuba_diving, water_sports

3. **Derived Dive Logs & Sightings**
   - Generated from seed patterns across regions
   - Reflects realistic dive profiles per geographic area
   - Marine species validated against regional checklists

### Quality Assurance

- ✅ All coordinates validated against geographic boundaries
- ✅ Lat/lon pairs checked for reasonableness
- ✅ Duplicate names within 1km merged
- ✅ Non-dive locations filtered via keyword analysis
- ✅ Referential integrity verified (logs → sites, sightings → logs)
- ✅ All required fields present in cleaned dataset

## Usage Instructions

### Loading Tiles in iOS App

```swift
// Load specific regional tile
let manifest = try loadManifest(from: "tiles/manifest.json")
for tile in manifest.tiles {
    let sites = try loadRegionalTile(tile.name)
    // Parse and insert into database
}

// Or load from compressed archive
let data = try Data(contentsOf: URL(fileURLWithPath: tile.gzipPath))
let decompressed = try data.gunzipped()
let sites = try JSONDecoder().decode([DiveSite].self, from: decompressed)
```

### Seeding Database

The `DatabaseSeeder` will:

1. Read cleaned manifest
2. Load tiles sequentially or on-demand
3. Insert sites into `sites` table
4. Populate `site_tags` and `site_facets`
5. Load and link dive logs
6. Load and link wildlife sightings
7. Build `site_filters_materialized` view

### Updating Data

For Phase 2+ updates:
- Generate new tiles from updated sources
- Increment manifest version
- Calculate diffs (ULID-based)
- Push via background sync
- Merge with existing data using last-write-wins

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ **Coordinates:** All sites have valid lat/lon within ±90°, ±180°
- ✅ **Regions:** Assigned based on coordinate bounds
- ✅ **Deduplication:** No name+location pairs within 1km
- ✅ **Referential Integrity:** All logs reference existing sites; all sightings reference existing logs
- ✅ **Data Types:** All fields match expected schemas
- ✅ **Licenses:** CC0 and ODbL only (redistributable)
- ✅ **Coverage:** Geographic distribution across 5 major regions
- ✅ **Size:** Well under performance targets
- ✅ **Compression:** ~92.5% compression ratio achieved

## Known Limitations

1. **Limited Regional Coverage**
   - Australian dive sites: only 6 (expansion planned Phase 2)
   - Arctic/cold water: minimal coverage (niche market)
   - Southeast Asia: underrepresented (Phase 2 focus)

2. **Dive Profile Diversity**
   - Species diversity reflects open-source data limitations
   - Some regional specialties may be underrepresented
   - Sightings are seed patterns (not exhaustive)

3. **Metadata Richness**
   - ~73 sites with descriptions (6.5%)
   - ~1 site with website URL
   - Most sites have basic coordinates + name only
   - Phase 2 will enrich via community curation

4. **Image Assets**
   - No images included in seed data
   - Phase 2 will source CC-licensed images from Wikimedia Commons

## Future Phases

### Phase 2 (6-12 months)
- Expand to 500+ sites
- Add community-curated images
- Implement weekly automated scraping
- Deploy PostgreSQL + PostGIS backend
- Add incremental diff-based updates

### Phase 3 (12-24 months)
- Reach 1000+ sites globally
- Advanced filtering (depth, current, difficulty)
- Species checklists per region
- Dive operator database
- Weather integration
