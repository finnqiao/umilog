The Yolanda cargo is still photogenic with toilet fixtures scattered around. Strong current on the return but manageable. Incredible coral coverage and colors.",

Massive school of barracuda (100+) formed a wall. Two green turtles munching on soft corals. The wall is absolutely stunning with colorful soft corals. Had to use reef hook at one point. Visibility dropped slightly compared to morning. Great dive!",

Tomato anemonefish were very territorial. Large school of barracuda on the north side. Visibility was good despite plankton. Surface interval revealed manta ray cruising by - missed it underwater! Will definitely come back.",
