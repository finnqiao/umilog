# 📋 UmiLog TODO (Map‑first Migration)

This list tracks the 2025 refactor to a map‑first IA with a 4‑step logging wizard and updated History/Wildlife/Profile.

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 3: Map V3 Implementation (10-19-2025) ✅
- [x] State mutation warnings fixed (MainActor, deferred updates, re-entrancy prevention)
- [x] Cluster styling enhanced (zoom-responsive radius + golden colors)
- [x] Pin visibility improved (zoom-responsive scaling + distinctive blue icon)
- [x] Accessibility added (VoiceOver announcements, dark mode contrast)
- [x] Viewport-driven content working (150ms debounce, real-time "in view" counts)
- [x] Bottom sheet polish (drag handle, dividers, visual hierarchy)
- [x] Diagnostics enhanced (layer/source introspection, annotation logging)
- [x] Initial centering fixed (15% padding, minimum spans, layout delays)
- [x] LEARNINGS.md documented with Phase 3 architecture notes

### Previous Completed ✅
- Replace long form with 4‑step Logging Wizard (Steps 1–4)
- Add SpeciesRepository (popular + search)
- Extend LogDraft with selected species + notes
- Implement WizardSaver (Dive + Sighting + ListState + notifications)
- Center plus tab: removed floating overlay, middle tab now triggers wizard and returns to Map
- Explore mode styling: distinct tint, chips use mode color
- Haptics on region/area/site taps; subtle animations for tier transitions
- Status chips (Visited/Wishlist/Planned) now navigate to Sites tier and clear region/area filters
- Toolbar wired: search sheet + filters sheet
- Fix numeric text field bindings by converting to String inputs with safe parsing
- Build succeeded on iPhone 17 Pro simulator
- Site details card updated to the "Grand Bazaar" pattern
- Map clustering compile fix: added MapClusterView.swift to the FeatureMap target via XcodeGen and corrected pin id extraction in didSelect; FeatureMap now builds cleanly
- Viewport‑based site loading via `SiteRepository.fetchInBounds`; MapClusterView propagates `regionDidChange` → ViewModel refresh
- MapLibre is the default map engine (DiveMap); MapKit retained as fallback
- **Database seeder implementation**: All JSON files loaded on first launch
- **24 dive sites** across Red Sea, Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Pacific, Mediterranean
- **35 wildlife species** with scientific names and categories
- **3 mock dive logs** with instructor sign-offs
- **19 wildlife sightings** linked to dives and species
- **SiteRepository enhancements**: Viewport-first queries, SiteLite payloads, FTS5, tags, facets, counts
- **Extended seed data**: 22 dive logs + 24 sightings with realistic profiles across all sites
- **Unified seeder script** (seed_integration.py): Merges sites/dives/sightings with schema validation & referential integrity checks

## ✅ COMPLETED: Phase 2 – Dataset Optimization & Integration (Oct 18, 2025)

- Memory: 0.32MB footprint (312x under budget)
- Compression: 92.5% effective ratio
- Status: **PRODUCTION READY** ✅

## 🌍 World-Scale Data Expansion (Phase 2 Roadmap)

**Vision**: Scale from 150 curated sites → 10,000+ dive sites worldwide with automated pipeline

### Infrastructure Requirements
- **Backend service**: FastAPI or Cloudflare Workers REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ with PostGIS extension
  - Spatial indexes (GIST on geography columns)
  - Materialized views for facet aggregation
  - Full-text search (tsvector + GIN indexes)
- **Job orchestration**: GitHub Actions (weekly) or Prefect Cloud
- **Storage**: S3/GCS for seed artifacts, tile caches
- **CDN**: CloudFlare for JSON tiles and incremental diffs

### Automated Data Pipeline
1. **Weekly scrapes** (with rate limiting + politeness delays):
   - Wikidata SPARQL endpoint (dive sites, coordinates, depth)
   - OpenStreetMap Overpass API (sport=diving nodes)
   - Wikivoyage scraper (regional dive site articles)
   - OBIS aggregates (species diversity per site buffer)
   - Government/NGO open data portals (when available)

2. **Deduplication & merge**:
   - H3 spatial bucketing (resolution 9–10, ~250m cells)
   - ST_ClusterDBSCAN within buckets (250m threshold)
   - Jaro–Winkler name similarity ≥ 0.92
   - Prefer open sources over restricted data
   - Store lineage in site_source table

3. **Quality assurance**:
   - Validate: coordinates in water (not on land)
   - Sanity check: depth 5–130m, visibility 3–60m, temp 0–35°C
   - Flag outliers for manual review
   - License compliance checks per source

4. **Nightly refresh**:
   - Rebuild site_filters_materialized
   - Regenerate search indexes
   - Export regional JSON tiles for offline use
   - Generate ULID-based diffs for incremental sync

### App Integration Strategy
- **Offline-first**: Always bundle "Open Core" with 150–500 curated sites
- **Optional updates**: Monthly background sync for new tiles
- **User control**: Opt-in for large datasets, opt-out anytime
- **Performance**: Maintain cold start < 2s, queries < 200ms

### Data Licensing & Compliance
- **Open Core bundle**: CC0/CC-BY/ODbL sources only; redistributable
- **Enriched services**: Non-redistributable overlays (MPAs, reefs) served via API
- **Attribution**: Auto-generate attribution.json per source
- **Coordinate fuzzing**: For restricted sources (±500m), if needed

### Scaling Targets
- **Sites**: 10,000+ dive sites across 100+ countries
- **Species**: 500+ with regional checklists
- **Shops**: 2,000+ dive centers globally
- **Media**: 10,000+ CC-licensed images from Commons

### Timeline
- **Months 0–3**: MVP with 150 sites (current sprint)
- **Months 4–6**: Backend service + automated pipeline prototype
- **Months 7–9**: Scale to 1,000 sites with weekly scrapes
- **Months 10–12**: Scale to 10,000 sites with nightly refresh
- **Year 2+**: Community contributions, mobile data collection

### Open Questions
- H3 vs. S2 for spatial indexing?
- Export Open Core as Parquet/GeoPackage for researchers?
- Support user-contributed sites (with moderation)?
- Real-time sync vs. monthly tile updates?
