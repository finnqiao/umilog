## üèóÔ∏è Development Process

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0+
- iOS 17.0+ deployment target
- Apple Developer account (for device testing)
- Homebrew for build tools

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install xcodegen swiftlint

# Generate Xcode project
xcodegen generate

# Open workspace
open UmiLog.xcworkspace
```

### Code Style

- SwiftLint enforces our style guide
- Run `swiftlint` before committing
- Use SwiftUI and modern Swift patterns
- Follow MVVM architecture

### Testing

- Write unit tests for business logic
- UI tests for critical user flows
- Performance tests for sub-100ms operations
- Run tests: `cmd+U` in Xcode

## üêõ Reporting Issues

### Bug Reports

Include:
- iOS version
- Device model
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Screenshots/videos if applicable
- Crash logs from TestFlight

### Feature Requests

- Check existing issues first
- Describe the problem it solves
- Explain your proposed solution
- Consider offline-first constraints

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Update Documentation**
   - Update README.md if needed
   - Update ARCHITECTURE.md for structural changes
   - Update TODO.md to reflect completed work
   - Update LEARNINGS.md with insights

2. **Test Your Changes**
   - All tests must pass
   - Add tests for new features
   - Test offline scenarios
   - Verify <100ms performance targets

3. **PR Description**
   - Link related issues
   - Describe what changed and why
   - Include screenshots for UI changes
   - Note any breaking changes

4. **Code Review**
   - Address feedback promptly
   - Keep PRs focused and small
   - Squash commits before merging

## üìä Performance Guidelines

Critical metrics to maintain:
- Cold start: <2 seconds
- Database writes: <100ms
- Search response: <200ms
- Memory usage: <100MB baseline

## üîê Security

- Never commit API keys or secrets
- Use Keychain for sensitive data
- Follow E2E encryption patterns
- Report security issues privately

## üì± UI/UX Guidelines

- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines
- Support Dynamic Type
- Ensure VoiceOver compatibility
- Test with wet fingers (seriously!)
- Design for one-handed use

## üåê Localization

When adding user-facing strings:
1. Use `LocalizedStringKey` in SwiftUI
2. Add to `Localizable.strings`
3. Keep keys descriptive: `dive.log.save.button`

## üì¶ Dependencies

Before adding dependencies:
- Prefer Apple frameworks
- Check license compatibility (no GPL)
- Consider offline functionality
- Evaluate binary size impact

## üéØ Focus Areas

Current priorities:
1. Offline-first reliability
2. Sub-100ms performance
3. Voice input accuracy
4. Import/export compatibility
5. Apple Watch Ultra integration
